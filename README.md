### What Can SORA Do?

Imagine describing a scene in detail--like a bustling Tokyo street at night or a serene coral reef--and having SORA bring it to life with vivid imagery and realistic motion. SORA can create complex scenes with multiple characters, dynamic environments, and precise details, all based on text prompts provided by the user.


### How Does SORA Work?

SORA is powered by a diffusion model, which gradually transforms noise into coherent video frames over multiple steps. Similar to how GPT models use transformers for language processing, SORA utilizes a transformer architecture for superior performance in understanding and generating visual content.


### Key Features of SORA:

- **Accurate Interpretation:** SORA deeply understands the language input, ensuring that the generated videos faithfully represent the user's intentions.

- **High-Quality Output:** The videos produced by SORA maintain visual quality and adhere closely to the user's prompt, creating compelling and immersive experiences.

- **Versatile Capabilities:** SORA can generate videos from scratch based on text prompts, animate still images, extend existing videos, and even fill in missing frames.

- **Real-World Simulation:** By simulating complex scenes and physical interactions, SORA lays the groundwork for future AI systems to understand and interact with the real world more effectively.
